S.A.F.I.R.B.U. is a apronym for 'Solution for Automatic Full Incremental Remote
Backup on Unix'.

Safirbu is a professional config file based wrapper around rsync to create
backups using the hardlink function to reduce required space by hardlinking
unchanged files. It also uses du, wc, and find to collect statistics of the
formerly made backups, if used.
It is mainly a file backup solution.
Its strength is especially the use of every-day programs on client side: The
most basic setup is rsync, ssh and a pre-shared key, so the backup server can
access it without human interference, and it has mechanisms for executing ssh
and local commands before, after, and in case of failed backups or failed
commands, run before the backup.
